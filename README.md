# Research-of-the-reliability-of-borrowers
## Description
The customer is the bank's credit department. The goal of the research is to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the bank clients affect the fact that the loan is repaid on time. The input data from the bank is statistics on the solvency of customers.
The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model — a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.
